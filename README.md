# Seneca
I intend to use this place for my school work. Ground rules:
-Seneca and its profs own copyrights to their content that I quote here.
-I own my work and it is also for creative commons and education purposes.
-Absolutely nothing here is for commercial or other inappropriate purposes. If someone misuses anything here, they do so at their own risk. Not my responsibility.
-Otherwise, ideas are copyright-free. :)
