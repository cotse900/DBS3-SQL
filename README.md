# Seneca
I intend to use this place for my school work. Ground rules:

-Seneca and its profs own copyrights to their content that I quote here.

-I own my work and it is also for creative commons and education purposes.

-Absolutely nothing here is for commercial or other inappropriate purposes. If someone misuses anything here, they do so at their own risk. Not my responsibility.

-Otherwise, ideas are copyright-free. :)

Public github demonstration of my prior work:

I own copyright to my individual and group work, whereas I don't own copyrights of things that I didn't write, esp. assignment and project topics.
Purely for demonstration and storage purposes. Do not copy anything or you would do so at your own risk.
My answers in all labs except lab6 were also "lab answers".
